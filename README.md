### Project Description
The rate of increase in carbon emissions today is alarming, and it seems to just keep on increasing. In this premise, we make this useless website where we enter a carbon emissions value (in tonnes), and get a hilarious response in return.                               

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Decrease in carbon emissions.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Here is how the website thinks:
Increased carbon emissions call for planting as few trees as possible.                                  
  
  
When the user enters a carbon emission value, each time "Submit" is clicked, it generates a random number for the trees to be planted, this number will not reduce even 10% of the carbon emission rate. The website, thus, mocks the user.

The name of the website and the tagline.                                                                                                                     
![Lesser carbon emissions](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58d7dc7e-39cc-4164-a6fe-76c14a3b85c2)

The number of trees to be planted for relatively lesser monthly carbon emissions, Collapse suggests less trees. 
![S![High carbon emissions](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61a984b8-aa89-45bb-ba70-a25a32b0cfa3)

The number of trees to be planted for high carbon emissions, for which Collapse suggests even lesser trees.

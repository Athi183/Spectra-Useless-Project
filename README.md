Project Description
The rate of increase in carbon emissions today is alarming, and it seems to just keep on increasing. In this premise, we make this useless website where we enter a carbon emissions value (in tonnes), and get a hilarious response in return.                               

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Decrease in carbon emissions.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Here is how the website thinks:
Increased carbon emissions call for planting as few trees as possible. This is how the website mocks the user. 
When the user enters a carbon emission value, it generates a random number for the trees to be planted, this number will not reduce even 1% of the carbon emission rate.
